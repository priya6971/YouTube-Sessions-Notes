Recursion in depth:
Recursion: Whenever any function is calling itself directly or indirectly.
Iterative: Using the concept of loops
def factorial(n):
	----	
	---
	n * factorial(n-1)
Application of recursion:
Divide and Conquer
Tree Based Data Structure
Dynamic Programming
Pre-requisite
Recurrence Relation: Master's Theorem, Recursive Tree approach, Substitution Method
Base case condition
Recursive tree
Stack(LIFO) data structure -> to store the function call

5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
5! = 1*2*3*4*5 = 120
